# TableChecker
Combine Excel files in Power Query a lot?

Save time checking the formats with this code, which checks through an entire folder of Excel files to ensure that the table format is consistent, returning the rows and columns into a sheet you can check at a glance! 

This code:
1. Loops through ALL Excel files in a folder
2. Counts rows and columns
3. Outputs an Excel file with the filenames, rows and columns, so you can check the format of all files at a glance without browsing through them manually!
