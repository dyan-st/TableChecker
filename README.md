# TableChecker
Check the table format of an entire folder of Excel files at once!

Save time checking the formats with this code, which checks through an entire folder of Excel files to ensure that the table format is consistent, returning the rows and columns into a sheet you can check at a glance! 

This code:
1. Loops through ALL Excel files in a folder
2. Counts rows and columns
3. Extracts table column names
4. Outputs an Excel file with the filenames, table column names, rows and columns, so you can check the format of all files at a glance without browsing through them manually!

Great to use before compiling large datasets with PowerQuery or similar software!
